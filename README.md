## Install
Make sure you have Python (â‰¥ 3.11) and Poetry installed.

Run `poetry install` to have it set up a virtual environment for you with the necessary dependencies installed and configuration taken care of.

## Running `cim2linkml`
Either activate your virtual environment (e.g. using `poetry shell`) or use `poetry run` to run the `cim2linkml` script.

### Usage
```
Usage: cim2linkml [OPTIONS] QEA_FILE

  Generates LinkML schemas from the supplied Sparx EA QEA database file.

  You can specify which packages in the UML model to generate schemas from
  using the `--package` parameter, where you provide the fully qualified
  package name (e.g. TC57CIM.IEC61970.Base.Core) of each package to select it.

  If no packages are specified, the entire CIM will be selected.

  By default, a LinkML schema will be generated for each specified package.
  However, by setting the `--single-schema` flag everything is outputted to a
  single LinkML schema.

Options:
  -p, --package TEXT     Fully qualified package name. [example:
                         TC57CIM.IEC61970.Base.Core]
  -s, --single-schema    If false, a schema is generated per package.
                         Otherwise everything will be outputted to a single
                         schema.
  -o, --output-dir PATH  Directory where schemas will be outputted.  [default:
                         schemas]
  --help                 Show this message and exit.
```

### Examples

#### The entire CIM with a schema file for each package

```shell
$ cim2linkml data/cim.qea
```

#### The entire CIM as a single schema

```shell
$ cim2linkml data/cim.qea --single-schema
```

#### A schema for a specific package, e.g. the Core package from IEC61970, outputted to a specified directory

```shell
$ cim2linkml data/cim.qea -p TC57CIM.IEC61970.Base.Core -o /data/output/
```

#### A schema for a specific package including its subpackages

```shell
$ cim2linkml data/cim.qea -p TC57CIM.IEC61970 -r
```
